# IT85 Laboratory 2 and 3 — Codex Project Instructions

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a Student Information Management System.

**Backend**
- Laravel 12
- Laravel Sanctum authentication
- MySQL database
- REST API
- PHPUnit tests

**Frontend**
- React + Vite
- Axios
- React Router
- Tailwind CSS
- Context API

Project structure:
- `backend/` — Laravel REST API
- `frontend/` — React application

The Laravel backend is the authoritative source for data, validation, and authorization.

## 2. Token Efficiency — HIGH PRIORITY

Minimize unnecessary token consumption without compromising correctness.

- Implement requested changes directly.
- Avoid long explanations and repeated progress updates.
- Do not repeat or summarize my prompt before working.
- Inspect only files relevant to the task.
- Prefer targeted searches over reading entire directories.
- Do not repeatedly inspect unchanged files without a reason.
- Reuse existing components, services, and utilities.
- Avoid unnecessary refactoring.
- Keep terminal output concise.
- Do not generate documentation unless requested.
- Do not perform web searches or use Exa unless explicitly requested or essential.
- Do not run redundant tests or builds.
- Make routine implementation decisions independently.
- Report only important findings, failures, and blockers.

Never skip necessary validation, security checks, or testing merely to save tokens.

## 3. Database Safety — CRITICAL

Development MySQL database:

`student_information_system`

NEVER execute against the development database:

- `php artisan migrate:fresh`
- `php artisan db:wipe`
- Database resets or truncation
- Destructive reseeding
- Destructive automated tests

Additional restrictions:

- Never delete existing seeded records merely for testing.
- Never modify existing academic records without authorization.
- Never change development database credentials without approval.
- Never disable foreign-key checks to force cleanup.
- Never run tests configured to reset the development MySQL database.
- Use isolated SQLite in-memory for automated backend tests.
- Inspect the testing environment before running database-related tests.

Normal authenticated API requests are allowed.

For CRUD verification, use newly created temporary records only when appropriate.

Do not perform destructive cleanup if relationships prevent safe deletion.

## 4. Backend Development Rules

- Preserve completed Laboratory 2 functionality.
- Do not modify backend endpoints without explicit approval.
- Inspect actual Laravel routes and controllers before integrating APIs.
- Do not invent endpoints, fields, validation rules, or response structures.
- Preserve Sanctum authentication and existing authorization.
- Never weaken security to make frontend functionality work.
- Report genuine backend limitations before implementing changes.

## 5. Frontend Development Rules

- Reuse the centralized Axios API client.
- Use `VITE_API_BASE_URL` for backend configuration.
- Never connect React directly to MySQL.
- Use real Laravel API responses instead of mock data.
- Reuse existing authentication, routing, and component patterns.
- Respect actual backend role permissions.
- Display appropriate loading, empty, validation, and error states.
- Keep the interface responsive and consistent.
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies and UI frameworks.

## 6. Error Handling

Handle relevant HTTP responses correctly:

- 200/201 — Successful operation
- 204 — Successful operation without response body
- 401 — Unauthenticated
- 403 — Forbidden
- 404 — Resource not found
- 409 — Conflict
- 422 — Validation failure
- 500+ — Server error

Do not expose raw stack traces or sensitive backend details.

## 7. Development Scope

- Work only on the requested feature or phase.
- Do not implement future phases automatically.
- Do not rewrite completed modules unnecessarily.
- Prefer minimal, targeted changes.
- If a major design decision or backend modification is required, request approval.
- Preserve existing working functionality.

## 8. Verification

- Run relevant tests when appropriate.
- Run `npm run build` after meaningful frontend changes.
- Verify real API integration when required.
- Clearly distinguish implemented features from verified features.
- Do not claim successful tests that were not executed.
- Avoid repeating successful tests unnecessarily unless affected code changes.

## 9. Current Project Status

Laboratory 2:
- Backend complete.
- Authentication, authorization, CRUD modules, documentation, and automated tests implemented.

Laboratory 3:
- Phase 1: Backend Review — Complete
- Phase 2: Frontend Setup — Complete
- Phase 3: Authentication — Complete
- Phase 4: Programs, Courses, Academic Terms — Complete
- Phase 5: Student Management — Complete
- Phase 6: Course Offerings, Enrollments, Grades — Verified for Admin/Staff
- Phase 7: Academic Record and Role Views — Implemented; Student self-service verification pending
- Phase 8: UX Hardening — Pending
- Phase 9: Testing — Pending
- Phase 10: Documentation and Defense — Pending

Known limitations:
- Existing Student test account has no linked Student profile.
- Instructor enrollment discovery requires an additional authorized backend endpoint.
- Phase 6 temporary verification records must be preserved until cleanup is explicitly approved.

## 10. Response Format

Keep final responses short.

Use:

Completed: ...
Tests: ...
Issues: ...
Files changed: ...
Next: ...

Limit routine reports to approximately 5 short lines.

Provide additional detail only when necessary to explain failures, security concerns, blockers, or requested decisions.
